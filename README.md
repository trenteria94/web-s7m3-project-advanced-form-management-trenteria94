 # Sprint 7 Module 3 Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Module 3 Project! In this project, you will practice input validation and submitting forms in React.

Your goal is to implement a form that validates input from the user and submits it to an actual registration endpoint.

To complete this project, you will need the following technical knowledge:

1. **Basic React** to manipulate props and the JSX.
2. **State hooks** to track the values entered into the form.
3. **Effect hooks** to validate form data as the user enters it.
4. **Event handlers** to change inputs and submit the form.
5. **Input types** like text, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns.
6. **Input validation** using the Yup library.
7. **Postman** to study the given endpoint.

## Instructions

You have received a take-home coding assessment for a Web Developer position as part of the hiring process. Your task is to implement **user registration** functionality for a site. User registration requires a form that takes user input, validates it in real-time, and submits the validated input to a registration endpoint.

From the point of view of the data, each user registration POSTed to the endpoint must contain `username`, `favLanguage`, `favFood`, and `agreement` properties. The form captures these values using inputs of different types. Here is an example of a properly built payload:

```js
{
  "username": "Luke", 
  "favFood": "pizza", 
  "favLanguage": "javascript", 
  "agreement": true 
}
// ‚ùó Note that even if the payload passes validation, the server may reject the request if the username already exists
```

### Endpoints

üëâ The registration **endpoint** is `[POST] https://webapis.bloomtechdev.com/registration`

üëâ Your fully-functional **design mock** is https://bloominstituteoftechnology.github.io/W_S7M3_Project

Study the endpoint using _Postman_, and study the mock site using _Chrome Dev Tools_, paying particular attention to the Elements tab and the Network tab.

### üíæ Setup

**Here are the steps to set up this project:**

1. **Clone this repository** to your computer.

2. Within your terminal, navigate to the project folder **and execute `npm i'**.

3. After successful installation **execute `npm run dev`**.

4. You will load the app in Chrome by **navigating the browser to `http://localhost:3003`**.

**‚ùó Note:** In the event of NPM errors during setup, delete the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, and retry `npm i' and `npm run dev`.

### ü•∑ Tasks

**Here are guidelines for completing your tasks:**

- If you look inside the `frontend/components` folder, you will find an `App.js` component. You will complete your tasks inside this file.

- The `App.js` component includes hints and pseudo-code in its comments to guide you.

- As you progress, the app's behavior will start matching that of the [mock](https://bloominstituteoftechnology.github.io/W_S7M3_Project).

- Use your attention-to-detail skills to ensure that the functionality of your form matches that of the mock as closely as possible.

- Have fun, and check out the Solution Video for this project if you need help!

#### üëâ TASK 1 - Implement submitting the form without validation

Below is a suggested sequence for completing this task:

(If you don't need hand-holding, feel free to ignore the suggestions. For an even more complex challenge, delete the contents of the App component and implement the form entirely from scratch. The only requirement is that the functionality of your form matches that of the mock.)

1. Create a state to track the values of the form. This state could be an object with `username`, `favLanguage`, `favFood`, and `agreement` keys.

2. Create states to store the success and failure messages from the server.

3. Fix the JSX to wire the change and submit handlers. Render the success and failure messages, taking them from their corresponding states, using curly braces.

4. Implement the change handler without any validation. The same handler should work for all inputs, with minor adjustments if the type is "checkbox".

5. Implement the submit handler: POST the form to the endpoint and store proper success and error messages in their proper states. Clear the form in the case of success.

6. You should have a functional form that relies on back-end validation only, without any frontend validation to help the user.

#### üëâ TASK 2 - Implement frontend validation using Yup

The frontend could be doing a lot more to prevent the user from POSTing data that does not meet the requirements of the API. Let's implement form validation using Yup.

Here is a suggested sequence:

1. Create a state to hold validation errors for all inputs. Create another state to track whether submitting the form is disabled or not.

2. Build a schema using Yup to validate the state of the form. Use the provided dictionary of error messages to guide you.

3. In the JSX code, use the submit input's `disabled` property to update the state variable that monitors if the form is submittable.

4. Create an effect that triggers if the form's state changes. When it does change, run validation on the whole form and update whether the user can submit it.

5. Edit the change handler so that validation runs on the changed field (e.g., `favFood`). Update the corresponding validation error in the component state.

The form should be fully functional now!

#### üëâ TASK 3 - (OPTIONAL) Start over from scratch

Delete the contents of `App.js` and challenge yourself to rebuild this form without help. If you decide to skip this task for now, we recommend revisiting it in the future. Consider this task a [Kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata) you should master before applying for a React position.

  <summary>I feel very stuck. What can I do?</summary>

Check out the Solution Video for this project in your learning platform. In it, an industry expert will walk you through their thinking in detail while they solve the tasks. We highly recommend viewing Solution Videos even if you are not stuck: you will learn many tricks.

<details>
  <summary>I am getting errors when I run npm install. What is going on?</summary>

This project requires Node to be correctly installed on your computer to work. Sometimes Node can be installed but misconfigured. Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install`. If that fails, try deleting both `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` before reinstalling. If all fails, please request support!

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I need to install extra libraries with NPM?</summary>

No. Everything you need should be installed already, including Yup and Axios.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I edit the styles?</summary>

Of course! Have at it.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I edit the HTML?</summary>

That's probably not a great idea. You need to be able to make all changes via React and not make any changes in the HTML files.

  <summary>My page does not work! How do I debug it?</summary>

With React, you need to use the React Dev Tools to monitor the state of our components as you interact with the App. If the state is not adjusting like you expect, that's good to know. If the state does change, but the UI does not respond, that's a different thing.

If your code has a syntax problem, the app will print error messages in the console. Focus on the first message. Place console logs right before the crash site (errors usually inform of the line number where the problem originates) and see if your variables contain the data you think they do. Comment out chunks of code until you get it to compile!

<details>
  <summary>How do I run tests against my code?</summary>

This particular project has no tests in it. All testing must be manual!

</details>

<details>
  <summary>I messed up and want to start over! How do I do that?</summary>

Do NOT delete your repository from GitHub! Instead, frequently commit as you work. Make a commit whenever you achieve anything and the app isn't crashing in Chrome. Frequent commits create restore points you can use should you wreak havoc with your app. If you find yourself in a mess, use git reset --hard to discard all changes to your code since your last commit. If you are dead set on restarting the challenge from scratch, you can do this with Git as well. Research how to reset hard to a specific commit.
